            <p>Buying a smartphone nowadays is not an easy task. With so many options available, it is important to know what to look for and what to avoid. Thankfully, this article can help you choose your next phone.</p>
            <p>This article is recommended for beginners and does not include in-depth information about smartphones.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="os">
            <h1 class="title">Operating System</h1>
            <p>It’s important to know which Operating System (OS) you want on your phone. Currently, the two major choices are Android (by Google) and iOS (by Apple). As of March 2023, the latest version of these two Operating Systems are <span class="italic">Android 13 and iOS 16.3.1.</span></p>
            <p>Both Operating Systems have their pros and cons. Android phones are more customizable, with various devices from many brands to choose. iOS is the Operating System installed in iPhones, known for its security and easy-to-use interface.</p>
            <p>It's important to use an updated OS to protect you from viruses. Security updates and good security practices are vital to keep your device safe.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="cpu">
            <h1 class="title">CPU (Chipset)</h1>
            <p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU, also known as a processor) is one of the most important components of any computer, including smartphones. A chipset interconnects the CPU, Memory and other devices. Most modern phones are capable of browsing the web without any problems. The most common choices are <span class="italic">Qualcomm’s Snapdragon CPUs, Samsung’s Exynos CPUs and Apple’s proprietary Bionic CPUs.</span></p>
            <p>Qualcomm has four Snapdragon series. The Snapdragon 4 series CPUs are made for entry-level phones. The Snapdragon 6 series CPUs are made for mid-range phones. The Snapdragon 7 series CPUs are made for upper mid-range phones. Lastly, the Snapdragon 8 series CPUs are made for premium phones (known as high-end or flagship phones).</p>
            <p>Samsung’s Exynos CPUs are a bit more confusing. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S10, released in 2019, is equipped with an Exynos 9820 (or a Snapdragon 855, depending on where you live). However, the S10’s successor, Samsung Galaxy S20, is equipped withan Exynos 990 (or a Snapdragon 865 5G, depending on where you live). Some Exynos-equipped Samsung devices can overpower their Snapdragon counterparts, but this is not always the case.</p>
            <p>The Apple Bionic chips are one of the fastest CPUs at the moment. Each iPhone upgrade includes a new CPU. For example, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is equipped with the Apple A14 Bionic chip. Its successor, the iPhone 13 Pro Max, is equipped with the Apple A15 Bionic chip. Finally, the iPhone 14 Pro Max is equipped with the Apple A16 Bionic chip.</p>

        <section id="gpu">
            <h1 class="title">GPU</h1>
            <p>The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is another important component. Common phone GPUs include Qualcomm’s Adreno series, Arm Holdings’ Mali series and Apple’s proprietary GPUs.</p>
            <p>The GPUs are part of the chipset included with the phone. In other words, <span class="italic">a phone equipped with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset will have a faster GPU if compared to a phone equipped with a Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipset</span></p>
        </section>
        <section id="ram">
            <h1 class="title">RAM</h1>
            <p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is also very important to computers. The more RAM your phone has, the faster it will perform and it’ll allow you to have multiple applications running at the same time.</p>
            <p>Every OS needs a bit of RAM to work properly. While iPhones may have less RAM than many Android flagships, Apple makes sure their proprietary OS runs properly on their phones.</p>
            <p>For now, <span class="italic">4 GB RAM is the minimum amount of RAM necessary to run Android without major performance issues. Although your phone may work fine with only 4 GB of RAM, it is recommended to buy a phone with 6 GB of RAM or more.</span></p>
        </section>
        <section id="storage">
            <h1 class="title">Storage</h1>
            <p>Your phone’s storage (commonly referred to as “memory”) is where you store all of your data. With the removal of a SD card slot in many phones and Operating Systems requiring more storage, <span class="italic">it’s recommended to choose a phone with 128 GB of storage or more. However, it is not impossible to use a phone with only 64 GB of storage nowadays.</span></p>
        </section>
        <section id="screen">
            <h1 class="title">Screen</h1>
            <p>The screen is one of the main features of a phone. After all, you will be staring at it every time you use your device. Modern phones are equipped with decent screens, ranging from HD (720p), to Full HD (1080p) or even Quad HD+ (3200p) screens. The bigger the resolution and screen size, combined with the screen brightness and other factors (refresh rate, for example), the greater your phone’s battery consumption will be.</p>
            <p>As for screen types, common ones include: Super AMOLED, Dynamic AMOLED (basically an improved Super AMOLED screen), IPS LCD, TFT LCD, Retina and Super Retina. The last two being Apple’s proprietary screen types. Apple’s screens are also made by Samsung. OLED (including AMOLED) screens have a better quality than LCD screens, but they are more prone to damage (burn-in, for example)</p>
            <p>Finally, the refresh rate indicates how fast your screen will be. A 60hz screen (most common refresh rate) can display 60 frames per second (FPS). A 120hz one can display 120 FPS. However, the greater the refresh rate, the greater the battery consumption.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="battery">
            <h1 class="title">Battery</h1>
            <p>The battery is also very important. There are two common types of batteries: Li-Ion and Li-po. Li-ion batteries are cheaper and more powerful, but they are more dangerous than Li-po. Li-po batteries are more flexible and less dangerous, but they don’t last as long as Li-ion batteries.</p>
            <p>Normally, <span class="italic">4000 mAh or 5000 mAh batteries are good enough.</span></p>
            <p>The more mAh a battery has, the longer it’ll last. For chargers, the more Watts (W) it has, the faster it’ll charge. Although some phones may not support fast chargers.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="cameras">
            <h1 class="title">Cameras</h1>
            <p>Modern phones are equipped with good cameras (sometimes, more than one rear camera). Although megapixels are important, the camera resolution is also important.</p>
            <p>Most modern premium phones are able to take pictures and record videos in 4K or Full HD (1080p). Some phones have a feature to record videos at 30 FPS or 60 FPS. It’s important to mention that bigger resolutions and more FPS equals bigger image sizes.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="p-a">
            <h1 class="title">Ports and Accessories</h1>
            <p>Most modern Android phones have a USB-C port and, rarely, a headphone jack. Older phones may have a Micro USB port instead. Many phones include options like a hybrid slot for a SIM card and a SD card, two slots for a SIM card and a SD card or a single slot for a single SD card.</p>
            <p>Some devices may still include a charger (and sometimes, earphones) in the box. Additionally, your phone may include a protective case and a screen protector.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="features">
            <h1 class="title">Common and Extra Features</h1>
            <p>Finally, it’s important to mention that most phones include some sort of speakers (either mono or stereo), GPS features, Bluetooth, WLAN (Wi-Fi) and a few other features.</p>
            <p>Premium and some mid-range phones may include more features, like a fingerprint sensor, facial recognition (although all modern Apple phones have Face ID) and other unique features, like Samsung’s DeX mode.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="summary">
            <h1 class="title">Which phone is the best for me?</h1>
            <p>Before you choose a phone, remember that <span class="italic">most mid-range and premium phones are able to execute any task. Although Android budget phones are more capable of performing normal tasks nowadays, a modern mid-range phone may be a better choice, although some don't have the same features of premium phones, they are cheaper than their premium counterparts.</span></p>
            <p>It’s important to know how much battery capacity a phone has, how great the camera is and how beautiful the display is. If you are unsure about a phone’s specifications, you can always look at the specifications on the company’s website. Hopefully, this article helped you decide which phone will be your next.</p>
